During the summer of 2024, I interned at Hansoh Pharma as a software engineer on the operations and science teams. During my time there, I worked on two major projects impacting operations and science research.

## Chemical inventory

I designed and built a chemical inventory management system, which was used by the operations team to track and manage their chemical inventory in their Rockville, MD sites.

## Chemical toxicity prediction

I built a web-based chemical toxicity prediction app, an early version of an predictive AI tool used by the science team to predict the toxicity characteristics of new chemicals.
