During the summer of 2024, I interned at Hansoh Pharma as a software engineer on the operations and science teams. During my time there, I worked on two major projects impacting operations and science research.

## Chemical inventory

When I started, the lab used a messy Excel spreadsheet to track their inventory of 1k+ hazerdous and fragile chemicals, which was quite inefficient and error prone.

I designed and built an inventory management system in PostgreSQL, along with a web-based interface and a barcode-scanning standard operating procedure to track and manage their chemical inventory.

## Molecule toxicity prediction

Meanwile, a science research team overseas in China was working on a predictive AI model to predict the toxicity characteristics of new chemical compounds. I built a fullstack molecule toxicity prediction system, an early version of a tool utilizing the predictive AI model to be used by the science team.
